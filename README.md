## Problem statement:
Airbnb is an online marketplace and hospitality service, enabling people to lease or rent short-term loading including vaction rentals. apertment rentals, homestays, hostels beds, or hotel rooms.

New users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in +34,000 cities across +190 countries, By accurately predicting where a new user will book their first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their coummunity, decrease the average time to first booking, and better forecast demand. We need to predict the first travel destination of a new user based on his personlized content .

## Data are provided by Airbnb on Kaggleâ€™s competition platform

1) rain_users.csv - the training set of users

2) test_users.csv - the test set of users

3) sessions.csv - web sessions log for users

4) countries.csv - summary statistics of destination countries in this dataset and their locations

5) age_gender_bkts.csv - summary statistics of users' age group, gender, country of destination

6) sample_submission.csv - correct format for submitting your predictions

## My Approach to this project:

Data collecting: downloading all the data provided by Airbnb to local.

Data Wrangling: data cleaning, seek mistakes in data, look for peculiar behavior, fix problematic/missing data.

Data exploration: use of classification, inferential statistics and data visualization to find interesting trends and identify significant features in the data set.

Data Analysis: data manipulation and modeling.
